#style.css
The CSS property you've written is incorrect.
The value for the font-size property must be a valid length unit, such as px, em, or rem.
A comma is not a valid separator for the length value.

So, the correct CSS would be:
font-size: 1.5rem;


#index.js
    There is a conflict between the name of the class and the instance created.
    The class is named "calculator" but the instance is also named "calculator",
    which will cause a reference error.
    The delete() method is declared but not implemented.

    The chooseOperation() method is declared but not implemented.
    The compute() method is declared but not implemented.

    The "equalsButtons" constant is assigned the result of "document.querySelector('[data-equals]')",
     which will only return the first element with the attribute "data-equals".
     If there are multiple buttons with this attribute, it will only bind the click event to the first one.

    The same issue applies to "deteleButtons" and "allclearButtons" constants.

    In the event listener for the number buttons, "calculator.appendNumber(button.innerText)"
    should pass the number value instead of the text representation of the number.
